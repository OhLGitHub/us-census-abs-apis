## INTRODUCTION

This repository contains an ETL report, project report, and Jupyter notebooks that use pandas to analyze data from the U.S. Census Bureau Annual Business Survey (ABS) APIs. The project report explores the following questions:

- How does an owner’s demographic information predict the success of the company, as defined by average annual pay per employee?

- How have the demographics of business owners changed between 2017-2019?

- How does a business’s state predict the success of the company, as defined by average annual pay per employee?

- How does a business’s industry predict the the success of the company, as defined by average annual pay per employee, between 2017-2019?
